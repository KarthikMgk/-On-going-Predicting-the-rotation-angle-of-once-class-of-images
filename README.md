## [On-going]-Predicting-the-rotation-angle-of-once-class-of-images
This project is an on going one where my aim is to predict the angle of rotation of images of one class to one of 0,90,180 and 270 degrees.

### Description
I'm using set of images of dogs from https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog. Dataset contains 4000 images for train and 1012 for testing.

### Goal
My goal is try and employ all possible techniques to improve the test accuracy close to 95%.
